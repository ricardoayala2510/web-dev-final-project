### Project Description
I am planning to build a website for my personal project called Dionysus, a gym clothing brand that I am working on with my friends for the Ecuadorian market. The website will serve as an online platform for customers to explore and purchase our products. 

The main features of the website will include:
- **Product Catalog:** Displaying our gym clothing products with high-quality images and detailed descriptions.
- **Shopping Cart:** Allowing users to add products to their cart and proceed to checkout.
- **User Accounts:** Providing customers with the ability to create accounts, save their favorite items, and track their orders.
- **Payment Integration:** Integrating a secure payment gateway for smooth transactions.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the website is accessible and user-friendly across devices of all sizes.

### Why I Want to Build It
I am passionate about fitness and fashion, and I believe there is a market in Ecuador for stylish and functional gym clothing. Building this website will not only help me and my friends start our business but also allow us to reach a wider audience and establish our brand in the market. I am excited about the creative aspect of designing the website and the opportunity to apply my skills in web development to a real-world project.
